    <h3>Optimising the aerodynamics of an airfoil using Machine Learning</h3>
</div>

Three parts are attached to this project :

- A [Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)](./1-pinn) to calculate the flow around an airfoil, and optimize its geometry to maximise its performances
- [3D printing of wing profiles](./2-wing-printing) which performances are characterized using physical experiments
- [An analysis of the previous experiments](./3-analysis) to verify predictions and automatically characterize the flow and exerted forces
